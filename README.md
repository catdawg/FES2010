Download link for the compiled game: https://dl.dropbox.com/u/16643844/FES2010.zip
You might need to install the XNA 3.1 runtime: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=15163

In order to compile the game, you might need Visual C# express 2008: http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/products/2008-editions/express

and the XNA 3.1 game studio: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=39


Development timeframe was around 3 weeks.

Major features are:

- Customizable teams, each player has specific stats such as speed, stamina or shot power. The stats and formation can be edited in a .txt file.
- The stats affect the players by giving them less accuracy when they pass or shoot, or making them run slower.
- Sprinting depletes two kinds of stamina, one permanent and a smaller one which replenishes very fast after a short time. While any of the bars is empty, the player cannot sprint.
- Cool AI! the players will defend intelligently, and the attackers will make sprints to escape man-to-man marking. If you can beat the AI you are awesome :D.
- If you beat the AI by a 3-goal difference you are in for an auditory surprise :D
