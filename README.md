###### DESCRIPTION

A 2D football game made in XNA for a Game Development course in the Masters Integrated of Informatics and Computing Engineering degree from the University of Porto. The development team was composed of:

João Xavier (jcxavier in github)
Ricardo Moutinho
Rui Campos (catdawg in github)
Tiago Carvalho


Development timeframe was around 3 weeks.

Major features are:

- Customizable teams, each player has specific stats such as, speed, stamina or shot power. The stats and formation can be edited in a .txt file.
- The stats affect the players by giving them less accuracy when they pass or shoot, or making them run slower.
- Sprinting depletes two kinds of stamina, one permanent and a smaller one which replenishes very fast after a short time. While any of the bars is empty, the player cannot sprint.
- Cool AI! the players will defend intelligently, and the attackers will make sprints to escape man to man marking. If you can beat the AI you are awesome :D (I can't :( ).
- If you beat the AI by 3 goal difference you are in for an auditory surprise :D
